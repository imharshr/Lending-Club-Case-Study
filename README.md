## Introduction

Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. Borrowers who default on their loans are the largest cause for loss for Lending Club. Lending Club wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default.
